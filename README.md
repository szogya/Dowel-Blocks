<h2>Credit and the goal of the project:</h2>
<a id="user-content-which-block" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Credit and the goal of the project" href="#credit_and_goal"></a>
The "project" based on the <a href="https://github.com/kieraneglin/Thumper-Blocks?tab=readme-ov-file#which-block">ERCF Thumper Blocks</a> ERCF v2 version. My goal was to eliminate most of the wobbles which exist within the original ERCF filament blocks. Hoping to get a more stable and consistent grip, I'm using 20x3mm metal dowels as shafts within the blocks. I also kept the ease of assembly and disassembly.
